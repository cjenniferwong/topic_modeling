I told her that I can’t be just friends after all she did to me. ; I told her about how many times she hurt my feeling called me fat, told me my pants were ugly and more.

All of her friends knew because someone told them  and I asked them and they all say she will react badly so I couldn’t I didn’t want to make her upset.; All of them said she would most probably run away and tell a teacher which I can’t do because they will tell my parents and even they don’t know yet.; When I get back to school I will get my closest fried since she already knows I will tell her what happened and ask her what to do because she had gotten me over one crush so what’s so different to another. If u don’t agree with her I will tell the girl and risk everything ',\n",
